Yet another single purpose site
===============================

After reading yet another article where the author kept using 'jive' instead of 'jibe', I decided it was time to publish a handy-dandy guide.

So, here you go, a handy-dandy guide on if you want to use the word 'jibe' or 'jive' (hint, it's probably the former).
