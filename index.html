		Jibe or jive; it's confusing. Use this handy guide and never worry about it again!
	</p>
	<div id="jibe">
		<h2>Jibe</h2>
		<p>
			<ol>
				<li>To be in accord, to agree.		
			</ol>
		</p>
		<p>
			Examples:
			<ul>
				<li>The facts don't jibe with his conclusion
				<li>Her opinion jibes with how I think it works too
			</ul>
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="jive">
		<h2>Jive</h2>
		<p>
			<ol>
				<li>Swing music or the swing dance
				<li>The jargon of hipsters
			</ol>
		</p>
		<p>
			Examples:
			<ul>
				<li>Grandma and grandpa still listen to jive but they don't dance anymore
				<li>I'm tired of listening to your jive
			</ul>
		</p>	
	</div>
	
	<p style="clear:both;">
		So, if you want to emphasize that two things agree or compliment each other, you want to use <strong>jibe</strong>. If you're talking dance or some killer swing music, you probably want <strong>jive</strong>... or dubstep, whatever, I'm not here to judge.
